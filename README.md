## Overview
Recent assertions indicate a rise in violent crimes in the UK, prompting significant government intervention and strategic responses. Analysis of crime data from various UK police forces spanning December 2010 to April 2013 was conducted through time series analysis. Despite visual indications suggesting a decrease in violent crime during this period, a more comprehensive statistical investigation, including decomposition into trend, seasonality, and noise components, revealed a different perspective. A Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model was employed to forecast future violent crime behavior, demonstrating high accuracy and performance.

## Motivation
This project aims to employ Correlation, Regression, and Time Series analyses to rigorously investigate the interrelations between variables including violent crime rates, firearm offenses, and drug-related crimes in the UK. The study seeks to validate claims of rising violent crime rates and forecast future crime levels for informed policymaking.

## Technical Aspect
To initialize the data pipeline, the crime data was downloaded from the above-mentioned website and imported in a csv.gz format to a Sparksession using Jupyter notebook. A Sparksession allows for the creation of dataframes, registering dataframe tables and querying of tables using SQL in Pyspark.

## Model Implementation

### Data Processing
The dataset comprising 65,078,250 rows and 12 columns, collected from December 2010 to April 2013, underwent meticulous review and manipulation using appropriate Pyspark functions. Missing values, identified as NA, were dropped to prevent bias in subsequent analyses.

### Data Extraction
Filtered and extracted data subsets were transformed into Pandas dataframes to facilitate conversion of string date types to datetime, enabling indexation for time series analysis.

### Time Series Analysis
A time series analysis was conducted to evaluate crime rate trends in the UK. The analysis revealed a decreasing trend in violent crime rates over time, with occasional spikes. A scatter plot further corroborates this finding, illustrating a gradual decline in violent crime occurrences over the evaluated period, punctuated by sporadic spikes in certain months.

To prepare the data for statistical modeling, stationarity was ensured through differencing. The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test confirmed the need for differencing to achieve stationarity.

The process of achieving stationarity involves several steps. Firstly, a visual inspection of the time series plot is conducted to identify sources of variation such as seasonal patterns, trends, and other fluctuations. Subsequently, the series is decomposed into its constituent components, yielding separate plots for trend, seasonality, and residual noise. Despite the decomposition revealing non-stationarity, a formal test for stationarity is conducted using rolling statistics and the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test.

The ADF test is utilized to objectively assess the need for differencing to render the series stationary. Subsequently, differencing is applied to eliminate trend and seasonality components, involving the introduction of a lag-1 differencing operator, denoted as Î», to the time series equation:

### Seasonal ARIMA Model
The Seasonal ARIMA model, designed to manage seasonality in time series data, was applied for forecasting UK crime rates. Despite its simplicity and interpretability, SARIMA's requirement for significant data amounts and assumption of linear relationships were noted limitations.

The model diagnostic evaluates the residual training data to assess linearity and normal distribution. Four plots are generated: Standardized residual plot, Q-Q plot, Histogram, and estimated density plot, alongside a correlation plot. The analysis confirms the absence of seasonality in the standardized residual plot, while histogram and density plots closely resemble a normal distribution. Q-Q plot demonstrates a linear relationship. Summary statistics, including Prob(Q) and Prob(JB), indicate acceptance of the null hypothesis, affirming a normal distribution of residuals.
